# Data Sorting Visualization

This Python project utilizes Pygame to visualize various sorting algorithms. The purpose of this project is to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work through a graphical interface that displays the algorithms in action.

## Features

- **Real-time Sorting Visualization**: Watch how different sorting algorithms organize data.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Includes Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, and a conceptual Quantum Sort.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can generate new datasets, choose different algorithms, start, pause, and stop the sorting process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

You can install Pygame with pip:

pip install pygame
Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/jmontgomery30/data_sorter.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd data_sorter
Run the program:
python main.py

Usage
To use the application, run the program and interact with the graphical interface:

New Data: Generates a new random dataset.
Algorithm: Cycles through the sorting algorithms.
Start: Begins the sorting animation.
Stop: Halts the sorting animation.
Exit: Closes the application.
